## Lesson 2: Making a GitHub Repository

A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history. In this lesson we will be creating a repository. This repository will be used later in this lesson when we create a blog to deploy to GitHub pages. 

The steps below will take you through how to create a repository on GitHub.

1. On the home page of GitHub click on the 'New repository' button on the left hand side of the page.

2. You will be taken to this page seen below. Fill in the repository name, click 'Public' to make the repository public, and click 'Initialize this repository with a README'. The README is where you can put information about your project. To finish making your repository click 'Create repository' button.
